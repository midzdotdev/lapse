<CollapseItem title="What is Lapse?">
Lapse is a timer that shows you how much time has passed since you last checked it.

You choose how you use it, but here are some ideas to track how long since:

- starting a task
- starting to procrastinate
- last drinking water
- last stretching

> Lapse isn't for everyone. If it works for you, that's great! If not, that's okay too.
